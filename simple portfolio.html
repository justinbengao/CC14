            <p>Parking Reservation Application</p>
	    <p>In the bustling streets of Baguio City, where traffic congestion and parking scarcity are common woes, a groundbreaking solution has emerged to alleviate these urban mobility challenges: the parking reservation application. This innovative mobile application represents a paradigm shift in how residents and visitors navigate the city's streets, offering real-time parking availability, reservation options, and user-friendly features to enhance the overall parking experience.

At its core, the parking reservation application aims to address the fundamental issue of finding available parking spaces in urban areas. Through meticulous observation and interviews, it became evident that both tourists and locals face difficulties in locating vacant parking spots across Baguio City. Navigating the streets to find parking often leads to traffic congestion and confusion, exacerbated by the lack of clear signage and information. This not only affects the efficiency of local residents but also detracts from the overall experience of visitors exploring the city's attractions.</p>
